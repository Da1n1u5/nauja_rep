* Make sure your RabbitMQ client versions matches your RabbitMQ server version. To see client versions available go to:
     http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.rabbitmq%22%20AND%20a%3A%22amqp-client%22
     
* If you need to change client version, set it in pom.xml and use manage-libs.xml with Ant to download new libraries. 
  Refresh and update project build path afterwards. 
  
 * To enable RabbitMQ web management plugin you may need to invoke:
     rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
     
   The web UI then can be found at:
